Welcome to the cascade folder.
I have provided two cascade models, that I've created as an example.
These models detect cross-objects.
Please provide your own cascade model if you want to detect other objects.
---
cascade_7stages: Works best for detecting crosses. 
cascade_8stages: Harder to detect model, but less false detections of crosses!
---
Please drag the files inside one of the two cascade-folders into this 'cascade' folder to use the function!

Properties of 7-stage model:
*Training time: 4days 7hours
*Accuracy: 90%
*Precision: 100%
*Recall: 80%
